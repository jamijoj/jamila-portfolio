# Viz 2: Global Government Debt by OECD country: 1995 - 2019
This grid chart displays global debt for the countries in the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD). The years represented are 1995-2019, though not all countries contain information for all of those years.

# A comparison of the visualizations
The dataset used for these visualizations was the downloaded from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It represents the general government debt for various countries from 1995 to 2019. All three of these visualizations represent the same data in different ways. While none is necessarily better than the others, they each serve a different purpose. The first chart is a simple bar chart, good at representing data at a fixed point in order to compare various inputs. In this example, the chart shows the general government debt for the year 2018. This is a simple and easy way to see the differences by country for the year 2018.

The second visualization displays a series of separate sparkline charts, each of which represents a country's debt from 1995 to 2019 as a line. This type of visualization is good for showing many different variables at once over a period of time. An alternative to this could be to represent the variables as lines on the same chart, though that risks getting messy and confusing very quickly if too many variables are involved. 

The final visualization is 4D, as it includes the element of time. It is an animated scatterplot that demonstrates how each country's debt has changed over time. The country of interest, Japan, is represented as a darker color in order to stand out. This is a great way to compare a single variable to a group of variables, as is being done here, but might not work if each variable needs to be given equal attention.
