#Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design







I found this visualization online and decided to use it for my critique because it’s on quite an original topic, global Lego prices, but the visualization has a lot of room for improvement. I actually really liked how the visualization employed a Lego overlay. It’s eye catching and fits with the theme of the article and of the entire site. But it loses a LOT of points for everything else. There are way too many numbers and lines, the color scheme makes no sense, there’s tons of redundancy, and the “highlighted” information isn’t apparent at all since every other element is shouting for attention.  I decided to redo the graph to make it easier to understand. 
Process
1. Critique
The first step in the process was completing a critique using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. I scored the visualization as follows:
•	Usefulness: 8
•	Completeness: 6
•	Perceptibility: 1
•	Truthfulness: 9
•	Intuitiveness: 2
•	Aesthetics: 4
•	Engagement: 2

The original visualization scored relatively well in the areas regarding what information was included but did poorly for how the information was presented. The audience for this visualization is people who buy toys for kids or  collecting, and the visualization is trying to communicate the countries with the lowest and highest Lego prices.  I knew that when I did the redesign, I would want to keep the same information but simplify the presentation and better highlight the key data points. I also thought the use of Lego within the visualization was really creative and in line with audience interests, so I wanted to try to keep that as well.

2. Wireframe
The next step in the process was wireframing a solution. I first assembled the raw data into a single dataset and cleaned it. After that, I spent some time trying to decide what tool would be best for wireframing a solution. In the end I landed on using flourish.studio and sketching.
