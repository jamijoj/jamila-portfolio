# Welcome!
This is my Telling Stories with Data portfolio. This is a selection of projects illustrating how I combined basic design skills and data to quickly and effectively communicate a message. The tools I used included Tableau, Shorthand, Flourish, Gimp, and Canva. I also used Python for data analysis.
