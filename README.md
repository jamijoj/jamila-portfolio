# Jamila's Portfolio
This is my Telling Stories with Data portfolio. Feel free to look around!

# About Me:
Hi all! My name is Jamila (she/her/hers) and I am a Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I took the course Telling Stories with Data in my second year to learn skills and versatile tools for effective communication with employees and other stakeholders.   

# What I learned:
In this class I learned how to combine basic design skills and data to quickly and effectively communicate a message. I also learned to use new softwares like GitHub and Tableau. I had ample opportunity to apply data analysis and graphic design skills I gained in other classes.
