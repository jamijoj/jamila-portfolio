# Jamila's Portfolio
This is my Telling Stories with Data portfolio. Feel free to look around!

# About Me:
Hi all! My name is Jamila (she/her/hers) and I am a Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am in my second year and I am excited to start working so that I can use all of these new skills I'm learning at Carnegie Mellon! I think that the skills I am taught in Telling Stories with Data will prove to be some of the most useful in my future career as an arts manager. These are versatile tools that will allow me to more effectively communicate with employees and other stakeholders, which I think is key to any management position.   

# What I hope to learn:
In this class I hope to learn how to combine basic design skills and data to quickly and effectively communicate a message. I also want to learn to use new softwares like GitHub (yay!) and Tableau. I know we won't leave the course as professionals in using these softwares, but I hope to learn enough so that I can continue learning at a more advanced level later on, should I choose to do so.
