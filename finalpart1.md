# Project Name:
“As the Donor Base Gets Younger, Arts and Culture Institutes Must Shift Their Focus”

# High level overview
This project will explore, through data visualization, changing demographics of non-profits’ donors in the US, their likes and dislikes, their motivations for participating in the arts, and their motivations for donating. It will draw on data from the National Endowment for the Arts and from Culture Track. The target group for this story is anyone who works in arts and culture nonprofits in the US.

# What is the aim/target of the story?
The target of the story is to show how the arts donor base is getting younger and how their motivations for participating in and donating to the arts are more based on socializing and doing good rather than prestige. 
After viewing the presentation, the reader should feel the urge to rethink their donor cultivation strategies and their donor prospects. 

# Project Structure: Key Topics/Points 

## SET UP

### The US population is getting younger

The US population is changing, people age 25-64 are the  [fastest growing group](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)

## CONFLICT

### The nonprofit arts/culture industry is reliant on old money, and cultivates prospects according to this, but potential donors are getting younger

-“Older generations have always been the bread and butter of individual arts giving, but demographic shifts suggest that middle-aged benefactors could become just as important.”
-“According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, wealth in America is shifting, with more millionaires in their 50s than in their 60s”
-“But young philanthropists do give widely to education and community development programs; experts are finding that they donate to arts institutions that champion education.”

### Younger generations and older generations differ on their reasons for participating in the arts and donating to the arts. 

Why are younger generations attracted to the arts?
-Social and interactive (millennial/gen x) vs Lively/Calm (baby boomer/prewar)

What are they participating in?
-Live music, fair or festival, art exhibit, such as paintings, sculpture, or digital art 

With the drive online due to COVID, has this changed? 
-No, in fact, people report missing spending time with family and friends as something they miss most

Donating patterns

Why do younger generations donate? 
-Younger generations: Community, Human rights and equality, Children, Health 
-Older generations: Community, Poverty Alleviation, Social Services, Religion, Disaster and Humanitarian Relief

How much are they donating, on average?
-More Millennials donate, but average a lesser amount
-11% of total US giving comes from Millennials, 84% of Millennials give to charity, donating an annual average of $481 across 3.3 organizations
-72% of Boomers give to charity, donating an annual average of $1,212 across 4.5 organizations.
-26% of total US giving comes from the Greatest Gen; 88% of the Greatest gen gives to charity, donating an annual average of $1,367 across 6.2 organizations.

## RESOLUTION

Connect with this next generation of donors on their level to make a case for funding
-Millennials are active on their phones and respond best to text message and social media, but rarely check personal email or respond to voice calls.
-Millennials are most likely to contribute to work sponsored initiatives, donate via mobile and watch online videos before making a gift.
-Gen X prefers text messages or voice calls. These donors regularly check email and stay up to date on social media feeds.
-Email prompted 31% of online donations made by Gen Xers
-Boomers answer voice calls, check email regularly, and use text messaging and social media. Though initially slow to adopt new technology, they take to it quickly once they do.
-Boomers are most likely to make recurring donations on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis.
-Greatest prefer voice calls and direct mail. These donors are late adopters of email and do not typically use text messaging or social media.
-Greatest are most likely to give through direct mail campaigns and donate physical goods.

Call to Action
Older generations still represent the largest source of funding for nonprofits for now, but younger generations are upcoming. Incorporate new strategies to cultivate new donors from younger generations by appealing to their interests – social interaction – and their motivations for giving (community, equality, child, and health initiatives.) Connect to them using methods they will respond to (social media, text messaging, email).
