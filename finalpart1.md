# Project Name:
“As the Donor Base Gets Younger, Arts and Culture Institutes Must Shift Their Focus”

# High level overview
This project will explore, through data visualization, changing demographics of non-profits’ donors in the US, their likes and dislikes, their motivations for participating in the arts, and their motivations for donating. It will draw on data from the National Endowment for the Arts and from Culture Track. The target group for this story is anyone who works in arts and culture nonprofits in the US.

# What is the aim/target of the story?
The target of the story is to show how the arts donor base is getting younger and how their motivations for participating in and donating to the arts are more based on socializing and doing good rather than prestige. 
After viewing the presentation, the reader should feel the urge to rethink their donor cultivation strategies and their donor prospects.
